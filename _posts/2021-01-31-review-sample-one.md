### *Summary*

*Musical Passage: A Voyage to 1688 Jamaica* is an exploration of Englishman and physician, Hans Sloane's discoveries while traveling to and living in Jamaica in the 1700s. His dedication to the study and preservation of the numerous cultures he explored over his twenty years of travel lead to the publication of his own book. The book and its subsequent volumes contain his findings of Caribbean history, engravings, ecology, and wildlife. The project's directors aim for the project is to introduce th ereader to some of the first known and earliers transcriptions of music which was created and performed by African slaves and survivors of the Middle Passage.

### *Design*

The project site design was built using coding languages HTML5 and CSS and the libraries jQuery, Bootstrap, and FullPage.js. The use of these design tools optimizes the readers experience on laptop and desktop computer devices, rather than mobile devices such as cellphones and tablets. The site's ability for the reader to hover over specific images, text, and audio on the page enables the reader to place themselves in the history and better experience the music that is being performed and translated.

### *Relevance*

The project does a great job of utilzing innovation and technology ot translate rich history and culture. The project's directors are well versed in the field of African American studies and music, two subjects that are the basis of the projects findings. The information presented in the text challenges other work on the topic by presenting not only factual evidence but also asking questions that could support further research. The directors do offer contact and social media information in which you can get into contact with them about further research and questions on the project.
